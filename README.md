## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software craftsman. I am passionate about building working and well-crafted software. I am interested in Web, DevOps, Cloud Platforms, and Agile. I believe in Software Craftsmanship and I value the eXtreme Programming practices such as TDD, CI/CD, Pair Programming, Refactoring, etc.

Enthusiastic about solving complex projects that impact millions of customers, leveraging data-driven insights and innovative solutions to drive meaningful outcomes.

You will possibly hear me often mention words like DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, simplicity, quick feedback loops, delivering fast - enriching later, mastering tech tools, discussing trade-offs in decision making.
