## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software craftsman. I am passionate about building working and well-crafted software. I am interested in Web, DevOps, Cloud Platforms, and Agile. I believe in Software Craftsmanship and I value the eXtreme Programming practices such as TDD, CI/CD, Pair Programming, Refactoring, etc.

I am very enthusiastic about Agile practices and frameworks that can assist us in being more Agile at work and allow us to achieve business goals as well as maintain psychological health in the work environment, and healthy team dynamics.

You will possibly hear me often mention words like DRY, SOLID, YAGNI, simplicity, quick feedback loops, delivering fast - enriching later, mastering tech tools, discussing trade-offs in decision making.
